## NewComp

Just a friendly heads up incase you missed ths last bullet point...
I have made a component called `NewComp` you can copy and paste this component to get started but don't change it or we will reject your pull request, sorry. Suggestions are welcome but we are pretty happy with it.
This component has an example of just about everything with a friendly non programmer comment to help you learn, how we do things, why we do them and what we expect when it comes to a pull request.
Lets take a tour and look at some of our standards
