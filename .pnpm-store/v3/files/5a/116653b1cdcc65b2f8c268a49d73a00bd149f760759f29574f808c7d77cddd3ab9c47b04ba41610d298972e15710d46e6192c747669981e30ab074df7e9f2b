 * Nx will compute it in the current process if:
 * * The process is running in CI (CI env variable is to true or other common variables used by CI providers are set).
 * * It is running in the docker container.
 * * The daemon process is disabled because of the previous error when starting the daemon.
 * * `NX_DAEMON` is set to `false`.
 * * `useDaemon` is set to false in `nx.json`
 *
 * `NX_DAEMON` env variable takes precedence:
 * * If it is set to true, the daemon will always be used.
 * * If it is set to false, the graph will always be computed in the current process.
 *
 * Tip: If you want to debug project graph creation, run your command with NX_DAEMON=false.
 *
 * Nx uses two layers of caching: the information about explicit dependencies stored on the disk and the information
 * stored in the daemon process. To reset both run: `nx reset`.
